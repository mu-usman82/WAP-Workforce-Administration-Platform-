# Workforce Management System
This repository consists of Java Program for Workforce management System. In this repository I have created a program which consists of 4 different operation.<br>
(1) Adding User<br>  (2) Removing User<br> (3) Updating User<br>  (4) Viewing details of User

The Program is completely based on OOPs concept to help some fresh grads in their learning.

Note: If you are a fresh grad or persuing your graduation you can refer this project as it follows best practices to write a program using OOP.

Have a good day :)
